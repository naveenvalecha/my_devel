# My Devel

This is a Drupal 8 module containing code and examples I often refer to in my
project work. It is not intended for production use as-is, and it is not
supported. It is effectively a collection of patterns and snippets for
inspiration and copy/paste. I hope, through use and refinement, to make some of
the features contributable to [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) or
other projects for greater reuse.
